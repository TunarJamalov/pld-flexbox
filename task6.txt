Task 6: Build a Flexbox Page 
Question: How can you design a page layout with Flexbox in mind? 
‚óè  Describe how you would approach building a fully responsive webpage using 
Flexbox.

Answer:
To build a fully responsive webpage with Flexbox, I would:
    Use flex containers for main layout sections (header, nav, content, footer).
    Set flex-direction to control layout flow (row for desktop, column for mobile).
    Use flex-wrap to allow items to wrap on smaller screens.
    Apply flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis to control item sizing and flexibility.
    Use media queries to adjust flex properties and layout for different screen sizes.
    Align and space items using justify-content and align-items for clean, adaptable design.
This approach ensures content adapts smoothly across devices.
