Task 3: Flex Axes and Properties 
Question: What is the difference between the main axis and the cross axis in 
Flexbox? 
‚óè  Describe how the main axis and cross axis are defined in Flexbox, and how they 
change based on flex-direction. 


Answer:
Main axis vs. Cross axis in Flexbox:
    Main axis: The primary axis along which flex items are laid out. It is defined by the flex-direction property.
    Cross axis: The axis perpendicular to the main axis.

How they change with flex-direction:

    If flex-direction: row (default),
        Main axis = horizontal (left to right)
        Cross axis = vertical (top to bottom)

    If flex-direction: column,
        Main axis = vertical (top to bottom)
        Cross axis = horizontal (left to right)

Similarly, for row-reverse and column-reverse, main axis direction is reversed, but axes orientation stays the same.
