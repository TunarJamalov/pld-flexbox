Task 2: Aligning Elements 
Question: How can you horizontally and vertically align elements using Flexbox? 
‚óè  Explain the properties you would use to align content along the main and cross axes 
in a flex container. 



Answer:
To align elements using Flexbox:

    Main axis (horizontal by default): Use justify-content to align items (e.g., flex-start, center, flex-end, space-between).

    Cross axis (vertical by default): Use align-items to align items (e.g., flex-start, center, flex-end, stretch).

For aligning the entire flex lines (if multiple), use align-content on the cross axis.
